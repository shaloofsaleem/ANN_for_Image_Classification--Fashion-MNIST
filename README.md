Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits. [here.](https://github.com/jauharmuhammed/README-Template)

## Why we made Fashion-MNIST

The Fashion-MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The images are labeled with integers from 0 to 9, corresponding to 10 different categories of clothing items and accessories. The categories are as follows:


- T-shirt/top
-Trouser
-Pullover
-Dress
-Coat
-Sandal
-Shirt
-Sneaker
-Bag
-Ankle boot

## Step 1: Installation and Setup

Artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used for image classification tasks. The basic idea behind ANNs for image classification is to train a model to recognize patterns in images and assign labels to them based on those patterns.

The most commonly used ANN architecture for image classification is the convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs consist of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
